# Installation & Setup
You can install Comments via the plugin store, or through Composer.

### Craft Plugin Store
To install **Comments**, navigate to the _Plugin Store_ section of your Craft control panel, search for `Comments`, and click the _Try_ button.

### Composer
You can also add the package to your project using Composer.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:
```
cd /path/to/project
```
2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:
```
composer require verbb/comments
```
3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Comments.

## Licensing
You can try Comments in a development environment for as long as you like. Once your site goes live, you are required to purchase a license for the plugin.
